Last day of the year. Time for that tooling retrospective.

If you work with JavaScript or TypeScript, you probably use the classic duo: **ESLint** for code quality and **Prettier** for formatting. I used them for years.

But in 2025, I migrated to **Biome**. And I don't plan on going back.

## The problem with ESLint + Prettier

Don't get me wrong — ESLint and Prettier are excellent tools.  
But using them together has costs:

- **Fragmented configuration**: you need `.eslintrc`, `.prettierrc`, and plugins to make both tools work together
- **Conflicts**: without `eslint-config-prettier`, the rules fight each other
- **Performance**: both run on Node.js and can be slow on large projects
- **Bloated node_modules**: each plugin adds dependencies

How many times have you lost time debugging why the linter complained about something the formatter just changed?

---

## What is Biome

[Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) (formerly Rome) is an **all-in-one** tool for web development, written in **Rust**.

It does:
- **Linting** (replaces ESLint)
- **Formatting** (replaces Prettier)

All in a single tool, with a single configuration file.

The crucial difference: it was designed from the start to do both things **together**. There's no conflict between linter and formatter because they're the same engine.

---

## Why Biome is so fast

The performance is absurd.

According to Biome's own benchmarks:
- **Formatting**: up to **35x faster** than Prettier
- **Linting**: up to **15x faster** than ESLint

This happens because:
1. It's written in **Rust**, not JavaScript
2. The parser is optimized for performance
3. It processes files in parallel natively

In practice, this means:
- Instant feedback when saving in VS Code
- Pre-commit hooks that fly
- CI/CD that saves precious minutes

---

## Radical simplification

Look at the difference in setup:

### Before (ESLint + Prettier)

```bash
npm install eslint prettier
npm install eslint-plugin-react
npm install @typescript-eslint/parser
npm install @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin
npm install eslint-config-prettier
```

Configuration files:
- `.eslintrc.json`
- `.prettierrc`
- `.eslintignore`
- `.prettierignore`

### Now (Biome)

```bash
npm install --save-dev --save-exact @biomejs/biome
```

Configuration file:
- `biome.json`

**One dependency. One config file.**

---

## How to migrate

Biome has an official migration guide, but the process is simple:

### 1. Install Biome

```bash
npm install --save-dev --save-exact @biomejs/biome
# or
pnpm add -D --save-exact @biomejs/biome
```

### 2. Initialize the configuration

```bash
npx @biomejs/biome init
```

This generates a `biome.json` with sensible defaults.

### 3. Run the formatter

```bash
npx @biomejs/biome format --write .
```

### 4. Run the linter

```bash
npx @biomejs/biome lint --write .
```

### 5. Or run everything together

```bash
npx @biomejs/biome check --write .
```

The `check` command runs linting and formatting at once.

---

## biome.json configuration

The configuration file is intuitive:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://biomejs.dev/schemas/1.9.4/schema.json",
  "vcs": {
    "enabled": true,
    "clientKind": "git",
    "useIgnoreFile": true
  },
  "formatter": {
    "enabled": true,
    "indentStyle": "space",
    "indentWidth": 2
  },
  "linter": {
    "enabled": true,
    "rules": {
      "recommended": true
    }
  },
  "javascript": {
    "formatter": {
      "quoteStyle": "single",
      "semicolons": "asNeeded"
    }
  }
}
```

Everything in one place. No need to sync multiple files.

## Prettier compatibility

A common concern: "will my code look different?"

The Biome team worked to achieve **~97% compatibility** with Prettier's formatting.

In practice, migration generates minimal diff. In some projects I migrated, the difference was almost imperceptible.

---

## VS Code integration

Install the **Biome** extension in VS Code.

It reads `biome.json` automatically and becomes your default formatter/linter for the project.

Add to `.vscode/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "editor.defaultFormatter": "biomejs.biome",
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "quickfix.biome": "explicit",
    "source.organizeImports.biome": "explicit"
  }
}
```

---

## package.json scripts

Update your scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "biome check .",
    "lint:fix": "biome check --write .",
    "format": "biome format --write ."
  }
}
```

---

## Next.js and the future of Biome

Relevant news: starting with **Next.js 15.5** (August 2025), the framework officially adopted Biome as the recommended alternative.

The `next lint` command was deprecated. Now you explicitly choose between Biome or ESLint.

When Vercel and Next.js adopt a tool, it's a strong signal that it's here to stay.

---

## Better diagnostics

Biome doesn't just point out errors — it **explains** the problem.

Diagnostics are clear, with autofix suggestions when possible. This makes debugging (and learning) more efficient.

---

## It's not all roses

Before migrating, it's worth knowing where Biome still doesn't shine.

### More limited plugin ecosystem

ESLint has over a decade of existence. That means thousands of plugins: `eslint-plugin-vue`, `eslint-plugin-svelte`, company-specific rules, shared configs, etc.

Biome is still building this ecosystem. If you depend on very specific plugins — especially for frameworks outside of React — you might miss them.

The good news: React/JSX and TypeScript support are already first-class. And the ecosystem is growing fast.

### Strong opinions about formatting

Like Prettier, Biome has opinions. It offers more configuration options than Prettier, but still: if your team has very specific or exotic formatting rules, there may be friction.

In practice, most teams adapt well. But it's worth aligning expectations before migrating an existing project.

### Less mature in edge cases

Being newer, Biome may have unexpected behaviors in less common scenarios. ESLint has gone through years of battle-testing in millions of projects.

That said, for the most common use cases (React, Next.js, TypeScript), Biome works very well.

---

## My experience

I migrated some personal and professional projects to Biome.

**What I noticed:**
- Much simpler setup
- No longer need to think about conflicts between tools
- CI became noticeably faster
- Fewer dependencies in `node_modules`

The only adjustment I needed was customizing some linting rules that were specific to our code standards.

---

## When to use Biome

I strongly recommend if:
- You're **starting a new project** — there's no reason not to use Biome
- You're tired of **configuring ESLint + Prettier**
- You want **performance** on large projects
- You value **simplicity** in tooling

If you have an existing project with very customized ESLint configuration and many specific plugins, evaluate whether migration is worth it. It might be, it might not — it depends on the case.

## Conclusion

Biome isn't just another tool.  
It's a **real simplification** of JavaScript/TypeScript tooling.

Absurd performance, minimal configuration, and no conflicts between linter and formatter.

If you haven't tested it yet, this might be a good New Year's resolution: **simplify your development setup**.

Happy 2026! 🎉

And may your code next year be clean, fast, and well-formatted — preferably with a single tool.

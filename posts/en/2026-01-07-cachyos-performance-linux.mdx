Recently, I decided to explore new frontiers in the Linux ecosystem and, on the recommendation of my friend [Otavio Rossoni](https://www.otaviorossoni.com/), I came across a distribution that caught my attention not only for its looks but mainly for its promise of **extreme performance**: **CachyOS**.

If you, like me, are looking to squeeze every drop of performance from your hardware, whether for development, gaming, or daily use, this post is for you.

## Context for Beginners

> 💡 **If you already know Linux and Arch**, you can skip directly to the "What is CachyOS?" section.

### What is a Linux Distribution?

Think of Linux as a car's "engine." A **distribution** (or "distro") is the complete car: engine + body + accessories. Different distros take this same engine (Linux) and build different cars — some focused on ease of use (Ubuntu), others on being lightweight (Linux Mint), and others on maximum performance (like CachyOS).

### What is Arch Linux?

**Arch Linux** is a distribution known for being "do it yourself." It gives you total control but requires technical knowledge to install and configure. It's like building a PC from scratch: you choose every component.

**CachyOS** takes this powerful Arch base and adds:
- An easy installer (no need to type commands)
- Ready-made optimizations for your hardware
- Configurations that "just work"

### What is Rolling Release?

Unlike Windows which has versions (Windows 10, 11, 12...), CachyOS uses the **rolling release** model — you install once and receive continuous updates forever. You never need to "format to upgrade."

---

## What is CachyOS?

[CachyOS](https://cachyos.org/) is a Linux distribution that takes the solid base of **Arch Linux** and adds aggressive performance optimizations. The difference is "under the hood."

The project's main focus is speed and stability, achieved through optimizations in the **kernel** (the system's core) and software packages.

---

## Key Technical Features

What makes CachyOS so fast? Here are the details:

### 1. Optimized Kernels

The **kernel** is the core of the operating system — it bridges your programs and the hardware (CPU, memory, disk). CachyOS offers custom kernels with different **schedulers** (CPU task schedulers):

| Kernel | Scheduler | Ideal for |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| `linux-cachyos` | EEVDF | General use (default) |
| `linux-cachyos-bore` | BORE | Desktop and Gaming |
| `linux-cachyos-bmq` | BMQ | Varied workloads |
| `linux-cachyos-rt-bore` | BORE + RT | Professional audio |
| `linux-cachyos-lts` | EEVDF | Maximum stability |

**In simple terms**: the scheduler decides which program uses the CPU first. **BORE** is especially good for gaming because it prioritizes fast system response. You can easily switch between kernels through the **CachyOS Kernel Manager**.

### 2. Packages Optimized for Your CPU

This is the most impressive feature. CachyOS **recompiles** Arch Linux programs with specific instructions for modern processors.

**Analogy**: Imagine buying "one size fits all" clothes — they fit, but not perfectly. CachyOS makes "tailored clothes" for your CPU.

It automatically detects your architecture:

| Architecture | Compatible CPUs | Benefit |
|--------------|-----------------|---------|
| x86-64 | All (fallback) | Compatibility |
| x86-64-v3 | Intel Haswell+ / AMD Ryzen 1+ | ~10-15% faster |
| x86-64-v4 | Intel Ice Lake+ / AMD Zen 4+ | ~15-20% faster |
| znver4 | AMD Zen 4 (Ryzen 7000) | Maximum AMD optimization |

**Technical terms explained**:
- **LTO (Link Time Optimization)**: optimization when "assembling" the final program
- **PGO (Profile-Guided Optimization)**: the program is compiled based on how people actually use it
- **BOLT**: additional optimization from Facebook/Meta for even faster code

### 3. Modern File System

The installer configures **BTRFS** by default — a modern file system with:
- **Automatic compression**: saves disk space
- **Snapshots**: "photos" of the system that allow you to roll back if something goes wrong
- **Better performance** on SSDs and NVMe

### 4. First-Class Gaming 🎮

CachyOS takes gaming seriously:

- ✅ **NVIDIA drivers** pre-configured (proprietary and open-source)
- ✅ **Patches for Steam Deck** and **ROG Ally**
- ✅ **HDR enabled** by default
- ✅ **1000Hz timer** — lower input latency (you press the button, the game responds faster)
- ✅ **Valve patches** for better game compatibility

## Who is CachyOS for?

| Profile | Why use CachyOS? |
|---------|------------------|
| 🎮 **Gamers** | Latency-optimized kernels, ready NVIDIA drivers, gaming patches |
| 💻 **Developers** | Faster compilation, optimized containers, rolling release |
| 🔧 **Enthusiasts** | Uses 100% of your modern hardware (Ryzen 7000, Intel 12th+) |
| 🎵 **Audio Producers** | RT kernel with ultra-low latency |
| 🐧 **New to Linux** | Easy installer + active community |

---

## Installation: Easier Than You Think

Forget the "difficult Linux" reputation. CachyOS offers an intuitive graphical installer based on **Calamares** (the same used by "easy" distros like Manjaro).

### Installation Options

- **Online**: Downloads the latest packages (recommended)
- **Offline**: Installs directly from the ISO (faster, but packages may be outdated)

### Available Desktop Environments

CachyOS lets you choose the "look" of your system:

| Desktop | Style | Ideal for |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| **KDE Plasma** | Modern, customizable (looks like Windows 11) | Most users |
| **GNOME** | Minimalist, touch-friendly | Those who want simplicity |
| **Hyprland** | Tiling, smooth animations | Advanced users |
| **XFCE** | Lightweight, classic | Older PCs |
| **COSMIC** | New, from System76 | Those who want to experiment |

After installation, **CachyOS Hello** helps you configure drivers, tweaks, and applications.

## Comparison: CachyOS vs Arch vs Ubuntu

| Aspect | Ubuntu | Arch Linux | CachyOS |
|--------|--------|------------|---------|
| Installation | Easy | Difficult (manual) | Easy (GUI) |
| Updates | Every 6 months | Continuous | Continuous |
| CPU Optimization | None | None | Maximum (v3/v4/Zen4) |
| Kernel | Generic | Generic | Multiple optimized |
| Gaming | OK | Good | Excellent |
| Ideal for | Beginners | Experts | Intermediate+ |

---

## Getting Started: How to Try It

Want to experiment? Follow these steps:

### 1. Check Your Hardware

Find out if your CPU supports x86-64-v3 or higher:

```bash
# On Linux, run this command:
/lib/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 --help | grep supported
```

### 2. Download the ISO

Go to [cachyos.org/download](https://cachyos.org/download/) and download the **KDE** version (recommended for beginners).

### 3. Create a Bootable USB Drive

Use [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/) or [balenaEtcher](https://etcher.balena.io/) to write the ISO to the USB drive.

### 4. Test Without Installing (Live USB)

You can run CachyOS directly from the USB drive to test it. Nothing will be changed on your PC until you click "Install."

### 5. Install (Optional)

If you like it, use the graphical installer. **Tip**: install in dual-boot with Windows if you don't want to abandon Windows yet.

## Conclusion

I'm using CachyOS as my *daily driver* and the difference in system responsiveness is palpable. The combination of Arch's solid base (rolling release) with modern compilation optimizations and specific kernels creates an extremely satisfying user experience.

**For technical users**: you'll have access to cutting-edge optimizations (LTO, PGO, BOLT, custom schedulers) without having to compile anything manually.

**For beginners**: you'll have a fast and modern system with easy installation and an active community to help.

If you want to refresh your setup and give your PC an adrenaline boost, give CachyOS a try. Your hardware will thank you.
